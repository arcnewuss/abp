Handbook editing

We need to edit the MBA Handbook.
=====================================

Reconciliate project and SOPW
====================================
1. The handbook requires that student should list eight to ten learning objectives  
    of internship in the Introduction part.
2. In the part of Scope of the Work, it requires student to identify work beyond the scope  
   of this project.

3. In the part of Deliverable Schedule, it requires student to describe milestones in detail.
